<pre><code>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of caching servers that speed up 
    the downloading of web pages and other content.
Amazon CloudFront is AWS CDN. It can be used to deliver your web content using Amazon’s global network 
    of edge locations

Distributions To use Amazon CloudFront, you start by creating a distribution, which is identified by a 
    DNS domain name such as d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net
Origins When you create a distribution, you must specify the DNS domain name of the origin—the Amazon 
    S3 bucket or HTTP server—from which you want Amazon CloudFront to get the definitive version of 
    your objects (web files). 
Cache Control Once requested and served from an edge location, objects stay in the cache until they expire
    or are evicted to make room for more frequently requested content

Signed URLs Use URLs that are valid only between certain times and optionally from certain IP addresses.
Signed Cookies Require authentication via public and private key pairs.
Origin Access Identities (OAI) Restrict access to an Amazon S3 bucket only to a special Amazon CloudFront
    user associated with your distribution.</code></pre>

</h3>
<pre><code>AWS Storage Gateway is a service connecting an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage 
    to provide seamless and secure integration between an organization’s on-premises IT environment and 
    AWS storage infrastructure.

Gateway-Cached Volumes 
Gateway-Cached volumes allow you to expand your local storage capacity into Amazon S3. 
All data stored on a Gateway-Cached volume is moved to Amazon S3, while recently read data is retained in 
    local storage to provide low-latency access. 
While each volume is limited to a maximum size of 32TB, a single gateway can support up to 32 volumes 
    for a maximum storage of 1 PB.
All Gateway-Cached volume data and snapshot data is transferred to Amazon S3 over encrypted Secure 
    Sockets Layer (SSL) connections. 
It is encrypted at rest in Amazon S3 using Server-Side Encryption (SSE). 
However, you cannot directly access this data with the Amazon S3 API or other tools such as the 
    Amazon S3 console; instead you must access it through the AWS Storage Gateway service.

Gateway-Stored Volumes 
Gateway-Stored volumes allow you to store your data on your on-premises storage and asynchronously back 
    up that data to Amazon S3. 
This provides low-latency access to all data, while also providing off-site backups taking advantage of 
    the durability of Amazon S3. 
The data is backed up in the form of Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots. 
While each volume is limited to a maximum size of 16TB, a single gateway can support up to 32 volumes 
    for a maximum storage of 512TB.

Gateway Virtual Tape Libraries (VTL) 
Gateway-VTL offers a durable, cost-effective solution to archive your data on the AWS cloud. 
The VTL interface lets you leverage your existing tape-based backup application infrastructure to store 
    data on virtual tape cartridges that you create on your Gateway-VTL.
A gateway can contain up to 1,500 tapes (1 PB) of total tape data. 
Virtual tapes appear in your gateway’s VTL, a virtualized version of a physical tape library.    </code></pre>

<pre><code>AWS Directory Service is a managed service offering that provides directories that contain information 
    about your organization, including users, groups, computers, and other resources.

AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory(Enterprise Edition),also referred to as Microsoft AD
Simple AD
AD Connector
    AD Connector is a proxy service for connecting your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory to the 
        AWS cloud without requiring complex directory synchronization or the cost and complexity of 
        hosting a federation infrastructure.</code></pre>

</h3>
<pre><code>AWS KMS: A service enabling you to generate, store, enable/disable, and delete symmetric keys
AWS CloudHSM: A service providing you with secure cryptographic key storage by making Hardware 
    Security Modules (HSMs) available on the AWS cloud

Customer Managed Keys 
AWS KMS uses a type of key called a Customer Master Key (CMK) to encrypt and decrypt data.
CMKs are the fundamental resources that AWS KMS manages. 
They can be used inside of AWS KMS to encrypt or decrypt up to 4 KB of data directly. 
They can also be used to encrypt generated data keys that are then used to encrypt or decrypt larger 
    amounts of data outside of the service.

Data Keys 
You use data keys to encrypt large data objects within your own application outside AWS KMS.
When you call GenerateDataKey, AWS KMS returns a plaintext version of the key and ciphertext that 
    contains the key encrypted under the specified CMK. 
AWS KMS tracks which CMK was used to encrypt the data key.
You use the plaintext data key in your application to encrypt data, and you typically store the 
    encrypted key alongside your encrypted data.
To decrypt data in your application, pass the encrypted data key to the Decrypt function. 
AWS KMS uses the associated CMK to decrypt and retrieve your plaintext data key. 
Use the plaintext key to decrypt your data, and then remove the key from memory.

AWS CloudHSM 
AWS CloudHSM helps you meet corporate, contractual, and regulatory compliance requirements for data 
    security by using dedicated HSM appliances within the AWS cloud. 
An HSM is a hardware appliance that provides secure key storage and cryptographic operations within a 
    tamper-resistant hardware module. 
HSMs are designed to securely store cryptographic key material and use the key material without 
    exposing it outside the cryptographic boundary of the appliance.</code></pre>

</h3>
<pre><code>AWS CloudTrail provides visibility into user activity by recording API calls made on your account. 
AWS CloudTrail records important information about each API call, including the name of the API, 
    the identity of the caller, the time of the API call, the request parameters, and the response 
    elements returned by the AWS service

A Trail That Applies to All Regions 
    When you create a trail that applies to all AWS regions, AWS CloudTrail creates the same trail in each 
    region, records the log files in each region, and delivers the log files to the single Amazon S3 
    bucket (and optionally to the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group) that you specify. 
    This is the default option when you create a trail using the AWS CloudTrail console.

A Trail That Applies to One Region 
    You specify a bucket that receives events only from that region. 
    The bucket can be in any region that you specify. 
    If you create additional individual trails that apply to specific regions, you can have those 
        trails deliver event logs to a single Amazon S3 bucket.</code></pre>

</h3>
<pre><code>Amazon Kinesis is a platform for handling massive streaming data on AWS, offering powerful services 
    to make it easy to load and analyze streaming data and also providing the ability for you to build 
    custom streaming data applications for specialized needs.

Amazon Kinesis Firehose:A service enabling you to load massive volumes of streaming data into AWS
Amazon Kinesis Streams:A service enabling you to build custom applications for more complex analysis 
    of streaming data in real time
Amazon Kinesis Analytics:A service enabling you to easily analyze streaming data real time with standard SQL

Amazon Kinesis Firehose 
    Amazon Kinesis Firehose receives stream data and stores it in Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon
    Elasticsearch. You do not need to write any code; just create a delivery stream and configure the
    destination for your data. Clients write data to the stream using an AWS API call and the data is
    automatically sent to the proper destination.

Amazon Kinesis Streams 
    Amazon Kinesis Streams enable you to collect and process large streams of data records in real time.
    Using AWS SDKs, you can create an Amazon Kinesis Streams application that processes the data as it
    moves through the stream. Because response time for data intake and processing is in near real time,
    the processing is typically lightweight. Amazon Kinesis Streams can scale to support nearly limitless 
    data streams by distributing incoming data across a number of shards</code></pre>

</h3>
<pre><code>Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) provides you with a fully managed, on-demand Hadoop framework. 
Amazon EMR reduces the complexity and up-front costs of setting up Hadoop and, combined with the scale of 
AWS, gives you the ability to spin up large Hadoop clusters instantly and start processing within minutes.

Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) 
HDFS is the standard file system that comes with Hadoop. 
All data is replicated across multiple instances to ensure durability. Amazon EMR can use Amazon EC2 
instance storage or Amazon EBS for HDFS. When a cluster is shut down, instance storage is lost and the 
data does not persist. HDFS can also make use of Amazon EBS storage, trading in the cost effectiveness 
of instance storage for the ability to shut down a cluster without losing data.

EMR File System (EMRFS) 
EMRFS is an implementation of HDFS that allows clusters to store data on Amazon S3.
EMRFS allows you to get the durability and low cost of Amazon S3 while preserving your data even if the 
cluster is shut down.</code></pre>

<pre><code>AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that helps you reliably process and move data between different AWS 
compute and storage services, and also on-premises data sources, at specified intervals. 
With AWS Data Pipeline, you can regularly access your data where it’s stored, transform and process it 
at scale, and efficiently transfer the results to AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon Relational 
Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EMR.

<pre><code>AWS Snowball 
AWS Snowball uses Amazon-provided shippable storage appliances shipped through UPS. 
Each AWS Snowball is protected by AWS KMS and made physically rugged to secure and protect your data 
while the device is in transit. 
At the time of this writing, AWS Snowballs come in two sizes: 50TB and 80TB, and the availability of 
each varies by region.
You can import and export data between your on-premises data storage locations and Amazon S3.

AWS Import/Export Disk 
AWS Import/Export Disk supports transfers data directly onto and off of storage devices you own using 
the Amazon high-speed internal network.
You can import your data into Amazon Glacier and Amazon EBS, in addition to Amazon S3.
You can export data from Amazon S3.
Encryption is optional and not enforced.
Unlike AWS Snowball, AWS Import/Export Disk has an upper limit of 16TB.</code></pre>

<pre><code>AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that helps you configure and operate applications 
using Chef.    
You can define an application’s architecture and the specification of each component, including 
package installation, software configuration, and resources such as storage.
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/continuouslearning/images/copied_from_nb/my_icons/Ops.png" alt=""></p>

<pre><code>The stack is the core AWS OpsWorks component. 
It is basically a container for AWS resources—Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS database instances, 
and so on—that have a common purpose and make sense to be logically managed together.
You define the elements of a stack by adding one or more layers. 
A layer represents a set of resources that serve a particular purpose, such as load balancing, 
web applications, or hosting a database server.
One of the key AWS OpsWorks features is a set of lifecycle events that automatically run a specified 
set of recipes at the appropriate time on each instance.
Finally, AWS OpsWorks sends all of your resource metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, making it easy to view
graphs and set alarms to help you troubleshoot and take automated action based on the state of your resources

<pre><code>AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend
less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.
You create AWS CloudFormation templates to define your AWS resources and their properties. 
A template is a text file whose format complies with the JSON standard. 
AWS CloudFormation uses these templates as blueprints for building your AWS resources.
