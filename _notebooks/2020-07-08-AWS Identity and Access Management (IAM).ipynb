    "### Introduction\n",
    "    IAM uses traditional identity concepts such as users, groups, and access control policies to control who \n",
    "        can use your AWS account, what services and resources they can use, and how they can use them. \n",
    "    The control provided by IAM is granular enough to limit a single user to the ability to perform a single \n",
    "        action on a specific resource from a specific IP address during a specific time window. \n",
    "    Applications can be granted access to AWS resources whether they are running on-premises or in the cloud. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    If your application identities are based on Active Directory, your on-premises Active Directory can be \n",
    "        extended into the cloud to continue to fill that need. \n",
    "    A great solution for using Active Directory in the cloud is AWS Directory Service, which is an Active\n",
    "        Directory-compatible directory service that can work on its own or integrate with your on-premises \n",
    "        Active Directory. \n",

    "### Principals\n",
    "    The first IAM concept to understand is principals. \n",
    "    A principal is an IAM entity that is allowed to interact with AWS resources. \n",
    "    A principal can be permanent or temporary, and it can represent a human or an application. \n",
    "    There are three types of principals: root users, IAM users, and roles/temporary security tokens.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Root User\n",
    "        When you first create an AWS account, you begin with only a single sign-in principal that has complete\n",
    "            access to all AWS Cloud services and resources in the account. \n",
    "        This principal is called the root user. As long as you have an open account with AWS, the root user \n",
    "            for that relationship will persist. \n",
    "        The root user can be used for both console and programmatic access to AWS resources.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    IAM Users\n",
    "        Users are persistent identities set up through the IAM service to represent individual people \n",
    "            or applications. \n",
    "        You may create separate IAM users for each member of your operations team so they can interact \n",
    "            with the console and use the CLI.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    Roles/Temporary Security Tokens\n",
    "        Roles are used to grant specific privileges to specific actors for a set duration of time. \n",
    "        These actors can be authenticated by AWS or some trusted external system. \n",
    "        When one of these actors assumes a role, AWS provides the actor with a temporary security token \n",
    "            from the AWS Security Token Service (STS) that the actor can use to access AWS Cloud services. \n",

    "        \n",
    "        Amazon EC2 Roles\n",
    "            Suppose that an application running on an Amazon EC2 instance needs to access an Amazon Simple \n",
    "                Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. \n",
    "            A policy granting permission to read and write that bucket can be created and assigned to an IAM \n",
    "                user,and the application can use the access key for that IAM user to access the Amazon S3 bucket\n",
    "            The problem with this approach is that the access key for the user must be accessible to the\n",
    "                application, probably by storing it in some sort of configuration file. \n",
    "                \n",
    "            An alternative is to create an IAM role that grants the required access to the Amazon S3 bucket. \n",
    "            When the Amazon EC2 instance is launched, the role is assigned to the instance. \n",
    "            When the application running on the instance uses the Application Programming Interface (API) to \n",
    "                access the Amazon S3 bucket, it assumes the role assigned to the instance and obtains a \n",
    "                temporary token that it sends to the API. \n",
    "                \n",
    "        Cross-Account Access\n",
    "            Another common use case for IAM roles is to grant access to AWS resources to IAM users in other \n",
    "                AWS accounts\n",
    "               \n",
    "        Federation\n",
    "            Many organizations already have an identity repository outside of AWS and would rather leverage \n",
    "                that repository than create a new and largely duplicate repository of IAM users. \n",
    "            Similarly, web-based applications may want to leverage web-based identities such as Facebook, \n",
    "                Google, or Login with Amazon. \n",
    "            IAM Identity Providers provide the ability to federate these outside identities with IAM and \n",
    "                assign privileges to those users authenticated outside of IAM.\n",
    "            IAM can integrate with two different types of outside Identity Providers (IdP). \n",
    "            For federating web identities such as Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon, IAM supports \n",
    "                integration via OpenID Connect (OIDC).\n",
    "            For federating internal identities, such as Active Directory or LDAP, IAM supports integration \n",
    "                via Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML). \n",
    "            A SAML-compliant IdP such as Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) is used to federate the\n",
    "                internal directory to IAM. \n",
    "            In each case, federation works by returning a temporary token associated with a role to the IdP \n",
    "                for the authenticated identity to use for calls to the AWS API."

    "#### Authentication\n",
    "    There are three ways that IAM authenticates a principal:\n",
    "    User Name/Password\n",
    "        When a principal represents a human interacting with the console, the human will provide a user\n",
    "            name/password pair to verify their identity. \n",
    "        IAM allows you to create a password policy enforcing password complexity and expiration.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Access Key\n",
    "        An access key is a combination of an access key ID (20 characters) and an access secret key (40\n",
    "            characters). When a program is manipulating the AWS infrastructure via the API, it will use \n",
    "            these values to sign the underlying REST calls to the services. \n",
    "       \n",
    "    Access Key/Session Token\n",
    "        When a process operates under an assumed role, the temporary security token provides an access key \n",
    "            for authentication. In addition to the access key (remember that it consists of two parts), \n",
    "            the token also includes a session token. \n",
    "         Calls to AWS must include both the two-part access key and the session token to authenticate."

    "#### Authorization\n",
    "    After IAM has authenticated a principal, it must then manage the access of that principal to protect your \n",
    "        AWS infrastructure. \n",
    "    The process of specifying exactly what actions a principal can and cannot perform is called authorization.\n",
    "    Authorization is handled in IAM by defining specific privileges in policies and associating those policies \n",
    "        with principals.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Policies\n",
    "        A policy is a JSON document that fully defines a set of permissions to access and manipulate \n",
    "            AWS resources. Policy documents contain one or more permissions, with each permission defining\n",
    "            \n",

    "            \n",
    "        Service\n",
    "            For what service does this permission apply? Most AWS Cloud services support granting access \n",
    "                through IAM, including IAM itself.\n",
    "                \n",
    "        Resource\n",
    "            The resource value specifies the specific AWS infrastructure for which this permission applies. \n",
    "            This is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). \n",
    "            The format for an ARN varies slightly between services, but the basic format is:\n",
    "            \"arn:aws:service:region:account-id:[resourcetype:]resource\"\n",
    "            \n",
    "        Action\n",
    "            The action value specifies the subset of actions within a service that the permission allows\n",
    "                or denies. For instance, a permission may grant access to any read-based action for Amazon S3.\n",
    "            A set of actions can be specified with an enumerated list or by using wildcards (Read*).\n",
    "           \n",
    "        Condition\n",
    "            The condition value optionally defines one or more additional restrictions that limit the actions\n",
    "                allowed by the permission. \n",
    "            For instance, the permission might contain a condition that limits the ability to access a \n",
    "                resource to calls that come from a specific IP address range. \n",
    "            Another condition could restrict the permission only to apply during a specific time interval."

    "        These policies are created in the Policies tab on the IAM page and exist independently of any \n",

    "        In this way, the same policy can be associated with many users or groups of users. \n",

    "    There are two ways a policy can be associated with an IAM group:\n",
    "    Group Policy\n",
    "        These policies exist only in the context of the group to which they are attached. \n",
    "        In the AWS Management Console, a group policy is entered into the user interface on the IAM Group page.\n",
    "    Managed Policies\n",
