    "    Amazon Redshift is a high-performance data warehouse designed specifically for OLAP use cases.\n",
    "    Traditional relational databases are difficult to scale beyond a single server without significant \n",
    "        engineering and cost, but a NoSQL architecture allows for horizontal scalability on commodity hardware.\n",
    "    Amazon RDS makes it easy to replicate your data to increase availability, improve durability, or scale \n",

    "    An Amazon Aurora DB cluster consists of two different types of instances:\n",

    "            This is the main instance, which supports both read and write workloads. \n",
    "            When you modify your data, you are modifying the primary instance. \n",

    "    Depending on the database engine and workload, you can scale up to 4 to 6TB in provisioned storage \n",

    "    General Purpose (SSD) General purpose (SSD)-backed storage, also called gp2, can provide faster access \n",

    "        for small- to medium-sized databases.\n",
    "    Provisioned IOPS (SSD) Provisioned IOPS (SSD) storage is designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive \n",
