    "    Stop guessing your capacity needs: \n",
    "        If you make a poor capacity decision when deploying a workload, you might end up sitting on expensive\n",
    "        idle resources or dealing with the performance implications of limited capacity. \n",
    "        With cloud computing, these problems can go away. You can use as much or as little capacity as you \n",
    "        need, and scale up and down automatically.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Test systems at production scale: \n",
    "        In the cloud, you can create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete your testing, \n",
    "        and then decommission the resources. Because you only pay for the test environment when it's \n",
    "        running, you can simulate your live environment for a fraction of the cost of testing on premises.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Automate to make architectural experimentation easier: \n",
    "        Automation allows you to create and replicate your workloads at low cost and avoid the expense \n",
    "        of manual effort. You can track changes to your automation, audit the impact, and revert to previous\n",
    "        parameters when necessary.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Allow for evolutionary architectures: \n",
    "        In a traditional environment, architectural decisions are often implemented as static, onetime \n",
    "        events, with a few major versions of a system during its lifetime. As a business and its context\n",
    "        continue to evolve, these initial decisions might hinder the system's ability to deliver changing\n",
    "        business requirements. In the cloud, the capability to automate and test on demand lowers the risk \n",
    "        of impact from design changes. This allows systems to evolve over time so that \n",
    "        businesses can take advantage of innovations as a standard practice.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Drive architectures using data: \n",
    "        In the cloud, you can collect data on how your architectural choices affect the behavior of your\n",
    "        workload. This lets you make fact-based decisions on how to improve your workload. \n",
    "        Your cloud infrastructure is code, so you can use that data to inform your architecture choices and \n",
