    "#### Types of Load Balancers\n",
    "    Internet-Facing Load Balancers\n",
    "        An Internet-facing load balancer is, as the name implies, a load balancer that takes requests from \n",
    "            clients over the Internet and distributes them to Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with \n",
    "            the load balancer.\n",
    "        When you configure a load balancer, it receives a public DNS name that clients can use to send requests \n",
    "            to your application. The DNS servers resolve the DNS name to your load balancer’s public IP \n",
    "            address, which can be visible to client applications.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Internal Load Balancers\n",
    "        In a multi-tier application, it is often useful to load balance between the tiers of the application. \n",
    "        You can use internal load balancers to route traffic to your Amazon EC2 instances in VPCs with \n",
    "            private subnets.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    HTTPS Load Balancers\n",
    "        You can create a load balancer that uses the SSL/Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol for \n",
    "            encrypted connections (also known as SSL offload). \n",
    "        This feature enables traffic encryption between your load balancer and the clients that initiate \n",
    "            HTTPS sessions, and for connections between your load balancer and your back-end instances."

    "        A record name of the load balancer. \n",
    "    Every listener is configured with a protocol and a port (client to load balancer) for a front-end \n",

    "   \n",
    "    Elastic Load Balancing supports protocols operating at two different Open System Interconnection (OSI) layer\n",
    "    In the OSI model, Layer 4 is the transport layer that describes the TCP connection between the client \n",
    "        and your back-end instance through the load balancer. \n",
    "    Layer 4 is the lowest level that is configurable for your load balancer. \n",
    "    Layer 7 is the application layer that describes the use of HTTP and HTTPS connections from clients to \n",
    "        the load balancer and from the load balancer to your back-end instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The SSL protocol is primarily used to encrypt confidential data over insecure networks such as the Internet.\n",
    "    The SSL protocol establishes a secure connection between a client and the back-end server and ensures \n",
