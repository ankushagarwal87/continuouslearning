    "### Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)\n",
    "    Amazon SQS is a fast, reliable, scalable, and fully managed message queuing service.\n",
    "    Amazon SQS makes it simple and cost effective to decouple the components of a cloud application.\n",
    "    You can use Amazon SQS to transmit any volume of data, at any level of throughput\n",
    "    \n",
    "    With Amazon SQS, you can offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly \n",
    "        available messaging cluster while paying a low price for only what you use.\n",
    "    Amazon SQS ensures delivery of each message at least once and supports multiple readers and writers \n",
    "        interacting with the same queue. \n",
    "    A single queue can be used simultaneously by many distributed application components, with no need for \n",
    "        those components to coordinate with one another to share the queue. \n",
    "    Although most of the time each message will be delivered to your application exactly once, \n",
    "        you should design your system to be idempotent\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Amazon SQS is engineered to be highly available and to deliver messages reliably and efficiently; \n",
    "        however, the service does not guarantee First In, First Out (FIFO) delivery of messages. \n",
    "    If your system requires that order be preserved, you can place sequencing information in each message \n",
    "        so that you can reorder the messages when they are retrieved from the queue.\n",

    "#### Delay Queues and Visibility Timeouts\n",
    "    Delay Queues allow you to postpone the delivery of new messages in a queue for a specific number of seconds. \n",
    "    If you create a delay queue, any message that you send to that queue will be invisible to consumers \n",
    "        for the duration of the delay period.\n",
    "    Amazon SQS supports up to 12 hours’ maximum visibility timeout.\n",
    "    By default, the message visibility timeout is set to 30 seconds\n",
    "    The default message retention period that can be set in Amazon SQS is four days.\n",

    "    Amazon SQS uses three identifiers that you need to be familiar with: queue URLs, message IDs, \n",
    "        and receipt handles.\n",
    "    Amazon SQS assigns each message a unique ID that it returns to you in the SendMessage response.\n",

    "            ReceiveMessage will check for the existence of a message in the queue and return immediately, \n",
    "            either with or without a message. \n",
    "        If your code makes periodic calls to the queue, this pattern is sufficient. \n",
    "        With long polling, you send a WaitTimeSeconds argument to ReceiveMessage of up to 20 seconds. \n",
    "        If there is no message in the queue, then the call will wait up to WaitTimeSeconds for a message to\n",
