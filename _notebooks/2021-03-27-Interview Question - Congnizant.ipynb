    "    Why constructor in Abstract class if it can't be instantiated\n",
    "    Why difference in Interface was being done in Java 8\n",
    "    when to use abstract class and interface\n",
    "\n",
    "    Read more: https://www.java67.com/2017/08/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface-in-java8.html#ixzz6qF6pGuYn\n",
    "    Ever since JDK 8 has allowed concrete (non-abstract) methods on the interface like default and static methods, many of my readers have asked me how should they answer the classical abstract class vs interface questions. Earlier, an interface cannot have any concrete methods and that was the main difference between abstract class and interface but now that is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "    the main difference between an abstract class and interface in Java 8 is the fact that an abstract class is a class and an interface is an interface. A class can have a state which can be modified by non-abstract methods but an interface cannot have the state because they can't have instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The second difference is that an interface cannot have a constructor even in Java 8 but you may remember that abstract class can also have a constructor in Java.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    https://www.journaldev.com/1607/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface-in-java\n",
    "    Interface or Abstract Class\n",
    "\n",
    "    Whether to choose between Interface or abstract class for providing a contract for subclasses is a design decision and depends on many factors. Let’s see when Interfaces are the best choice and when can we use abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Java doesn’t support multiple class level inheritance, so every class can extend only one superclass. But a class can implement multiple interfaces. So most of the times Interfaces are a good choice for providing the base for class hierarchy and contract. Also coding in terms of interfaces is one of the best practices for coding in java.\n",
    "    If there are a lot of methods in the contract, then abstract class is more useful because we can provide a default implementation for some of the methods that are common for all the subclasses. Also if subclasses don’t need to implement a particular method, they can avoid providing the implementation but in case of interface, the subclass will have to provide the implementation for all the methods even though it’s of no use and implementation is just empty block.\n",
    "    If our base contract keeps on changing then interfaces can cause issues because we can’t declare additional methods to the interface without changing all the implementation classes, with the abstract class we can provide the default implementation and only change the implementation classes that are actually going to use the new methods.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Use Abstract classes and Interface both\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using interfaces and abstract classes together is the best approach to design a system. For example, in JDK java.util.List is an interface that contains a lot of methods, so there is an abstract class java.util.AbstractList that provides a skeletal implementation for all the methods of List interface so that any subclass can extend this class and implement only required methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We should always start with an interface as the base and define methods that every subclass should implement and then if there are some methods that only certain subclass should implement, we can extend the base interface and create a new interface with those methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The subclasses will have the option to chose between the base interface or the child interface to implement according to its requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the number of methods grows a lot, it’s not a bad idea to provide a skeletal abstract class implementing the child interface and providing flexibility to the subclasses to chose between interface and an abstract class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An abstract class is a special type of class that cannot be instantiated. An abstract class is designed to be inherited by subclasses that either implement or override its methods.\n",

    "    Consider using abstract classes if any of these statements apply to your situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    You want to share code among several closely related classes.\n",
    "    You expect that classes that extend your abstract class have many common methods or fields or require access modifiers other than public (such as protected and private).\n",
    "    You want to declare non-static or non-final fields. This enables you to define methods that can access and modify the state of the object to which they belong.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider using interfaces if any of these statements apply to your situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    You expect that unrelated classes would implement your interface. For example, the interfaces Comparable and Cloneable are implemented by many unrelated classes.\n",
    "    You want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements its behavior.\n",
    "    You want to take advantage of multiple inheritances.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A constructor is used to initializing non-static data members and as there are no non-static data members in the interface, there is no need of constructor in Interface\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The main purpose of the constructor is to initialize the newly created object. In abstract class, we have an instance variable, abstract methods, and non-abstract methods. We need to initialize the non-abstract methods and instance variables, therefore abstract classes have a constructor. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The constructor inside the abstract class can only be called during constructor chaining i.e. when we create an instance of sub-classes. This is also one of the reasons abstract class can have a constructor.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2170500/why-do-abstract-classes-in-java-have-constructors\n",
    "    A constructor in Java doesn't actually \"build\" the object, it is used to initialize fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Imagine that your abstract class has fields x and y, and that you always want them to be initialized in a certain way, no matter what actual concrete subclass is eventually created. So you create a constructor and initialize these fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, if you have two different subclasses of your abstract class, when you instantiate them their constructors will be called, and then the parent constructor will be called and the fields will be initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you don't do anything, the default constructor of the parent will be called. However, you can use the super keyword to invoke specific constructor on the parent class.\n"

    "\n",
    "    2) Search (get method) operations are fast in Arraylist (O(1)) but not in LinkedList (O(n)) so If there are less add and remove operations and more search operations requirement, ArrayList would be your best bet.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    https://www.baeldung.com/java-arraylist-linkedlist\n",
    "    To add a new item, we should first initialize a brand new array with more capacity and copy all existing items to the new array. Only after copying current elements can we add the new item. Hence, the time complexity is O(n) in the worst case since we have to copy n elements first.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/322715/when-to-use-linkedlist-over-arraylist-in-java\n",
    "    Also, if you have large lists, keep in mind that memory usage is also different. Each element of a LinkedList has more overhead since pointers to the next and previous elements are also stored. ArrayLists don't have this overhead. However, ArrayLists take up as much memory as is allocated for the capacity, regardless of whether elements have actually been added.\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    Mainly - that the nodes of the LinkedList are scattered randomly across the memory. RAM (\"Random Access Memory\") isn't really random and blocks of memory need to be fetched to cache. This operation takes time, and when such fetches happen frequently - the memory pages in the cache need to be replaced all the time -> Cache misses -> Cache is not efficient. ArrayList elements are stored on continuous memory - which is exactly what the modern CPU architecture is optimizing for.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Reverse Iterator\n",
    "    LinkedList can be iterated in reverse direction using descendingIterator() while there is no descendingIterator() in ArrayList , so we need to write our own code to iterate over the ArrayList in reverse direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Memory Overhead\n",
    "    Memory overhead in LinkedList is more as compared to ArrayList as a node in LinkedList needs to maintain the addresses of the next and previous node. While In ArrayList each index only holds the actual object(data).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The iterator and listIterator returned by these classes are fail-fast (if list is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator’s own remove or add methods, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException)."

    "    Fail-Fast iterators, returned by most of the collection types, doesn’t tolerate any structural modifications to a collection while iterating over it. (Structural modifications means add, remove or updating an element in the collection). They throw ConcurrentModificationException if a collection is structurally modified while iteration is going on the collection. But, they don’t throw any exceptions if the collection is modified by the iterator’s own methods like remove().\n",

    "    Fail-Safe iterators don’t throw any exceptions if the collection is modified while iterating over it. Because, they iterate on the clone of the collection not on the original collection. So, any structural modifications done on the original collection goes unnoticed by these iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "    But, these iterators have some drawbacks. One of them is that it is not always guaranteed that you will get up-to-date data while iterating. Because, any modifications to the collection after the creation of iterator is not updated in the iterator. One more disadvantage of these iterators is that there will be additional overhead of creating the copy of the collection in the terms of both time and memory."
