    "\n",
    "    Amazon VPC is the networking layer for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and it allows \n",
    "    you to build your own virtual network within AWS. \n",
    "    You control various aspects of your Amazon VPC, including selecting your own IP address range; \n",
    "    creating your own subnets; and configuring your own route tables, network gateways, and security \n",
    "    settings. Within a region, you can create multiple Amazon VPCs, and each Amazon VPC is logically \n",
    "    isolated even if it shares its IP address space.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When you create an Amazon VPC, you must specify the IPv4 address range by choosing a Classless \n",
    "    Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block, such as 10.0.0.0/16. \n",
    "    The address range of the Amazon VPC cannot be changed after the Amazon VPC is created. \n",
    "    An Amazon VPC address range may be as large as /16 (65,536 available addresses) or as small as /28 \n",
    "    (16 available addresses) and should not overlap any other network with which they are to be connected.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An Amazon VPC consists of the following components:\n",
    "        Subnets\n",
    "        Route tables\n",
