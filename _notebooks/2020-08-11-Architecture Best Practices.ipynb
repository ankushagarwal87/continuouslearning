    "        Consider only storing a unique session identifier in a HTTP cookie and storing more detailed user \n",
    "        session information server-side. Most programming platforms provide a native session management \n",
    "        mechanism that works this way; however, these management mechanisms often store the session \n",
    "        information locally by default. This would result in a stateful architecture. \n",
    "        A common solution to this problem is to store user session information in a database. \n",
    "        Amazon DynamoDB is a great choice due to its scalability, high availability, and durability\n",
    "        characteristics. For many platforms, there are open source, drop-in replacement libraries that \n",
    "        allow you to store native sessions in Amazon DynamoDB.\n",

    "        Services like AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) can help protect your web applications \n",
    "        from SQL injection and other vulnerabilities in your application code\n",
