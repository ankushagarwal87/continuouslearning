    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "    Amazon S3 serves as the durable target storage for Amazon Kinesis and Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR),\n",
    "        it is used as the storage for Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and Amazon Relational Database\n",
    "        Service (Amazon RDS) snapshots, and it is used as a data staging or loading storage mechanism for \n",
    "        Amazon Redshift and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "           \n",
    "    Amazon S3 objects are automatically replicated on multiple devices in multiple facilities within a region.\n",
    "    You can create and use multiple buckets; you can have up to 100 per account by default.\n",
    "    Objects can range in size from 0 bytes upto 5TB,and a single bucket can store an unlimited number of objects\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The native interface for Amazon S3 is a REST (Representational State Transfer) API. \n",
    "        With the REST interface, you use standard HTTP or HTTPS requests to create and delete buckets, \n",
    "        list keys, and read and write objects.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Amazon S3 achieves high durability by automatically storing data redundantly on multiple devices in\n",
    "        multiple facilities within a region. It is designed to sustain the concurrent loss of data in two\n",
    "        facilities without loss of user data. "

    "### Access Control\n",
    "    Amazon S3 is secure by default; when you create a bucket or object in Amazon S3, only you have access. \n",
    "        To allow you to give controlled access to others, Amazon S3 provides both coarse-grained access \n",
    "        controls (Amazon S3 Access Control Lists [ACLs]), and fine-grained access controls (Amazon S3 \n",
    "        bucket policies, AWS Identity and Access Management [IAM] policies, and query-string authentication).\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Using an Amazon S3 bucket policy, you can specify who can access the bucket, from where (by Classless \n",
    "        Inter-Domain Routing [CIDR] block or IP address), and during what time of day.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Finally, IAM policies may be associated directly with IAM principals that grant access to an Amazon \n",
    "        S3 bucket, just as it can grant access to any AWS service and resource. \n",
    "        \n",
    "    Lifecycle configurations are attached to the bucket and can apply to all objects in the bucket or \n",
    "        only to objects specified by a prefix."

    "### Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "    To encrypt your Amazon S3 data in flight, you can use the Amazon S3 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) API \n",
    "        endpoints. This ensures that all data sent to and from Amazon S3 is encrypted while in transit \n",
    "        using the HTTPS protocol.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    To encrypt your Amazon S3 data at rest, you can use several variations of Server-Side Encryption (SSE). \n",
    "        Amazon S3 encrypts your data at the object level as it writes it to disks in its data centers and \n",
    "        decrypts it for you when you access it. All SSE performed by Amazon S3 and AWS Key Management Service\n",
    "        (Amazon KMS) uses the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). You can also encrypt your Amazon \n",
    "        S3 data at rest using Client-Side Encryption, encrypting your data on the client before sending it \n",
    "        to Amazon S3.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    SSE-S3 (AWS-Managed Keys)\n",
    "        This is a fully integrated “check-box-style” encryption solution where AWS handles the key management \n",
    "        and key protection for Amazon S3. Every object is encrypted with a unique key. The actual object key \n",
    "        itself is then further encrypted by a separate master key. A new master key is issued at least monthly, \n",
    "        with AWS rotating the keys. Encrypted data, encryption keys, and master keys are all stored separately\n",
    "        on secure hosts, further enhancing protection.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    SSE-KMS (AWS KMS Keys)\n",
    "        This is a fully integrated solution where Amazon handles your key management and protection for \n",
    "        Amazon S3, but where you manage the keys. SSE-KMS offers several additional benefits compared to SSE-S3.\n",
    "        Using SSE-KMS, there are separate permissions for using the master key, which provide protection against\n",
    "        unauthorized access to your objects stored in Amazon S3 and an additional layer of control.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    SSE-C (Customer-Provided Keys)\n",
    "        This is used when you want to maintain your own encryption keys but don’t want to manage or implement \n",
    "        your own client-side encryption library. With SSE-C, AWS will do the encryption/decryption of your \n",
    "        objects while you maintain full control of the keys used to encrypt/decrypt the objects in Amazon S3.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    Client-Side Encryption\n",
    "        Client-side encryption refers to encrypting data on the client side of your application before sending \n",
    "        it to Amazon S3. "

    "### Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pre-Signed URLs\n",
    "        All Amazon S3 objects by default are private, meaning that only the owner has access. However, the \n",
    "        object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a pre-signed URL, using their own\n",
    "        security credentials to grant time-limited permission to download the objects. When you create a \n",
    "        pre-signed URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials and specify a bucket name, \n",
    "        an object key, the HTTP method (GET to download the object), and an expiration date and time. The \n",
    "        pre-signed URLs are valid only for the specified duration. This is particularly useful to protect \n",
    "        against “content scraping” of web content such as media files stored in Amazon S3.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Multipart Upload\n",
    "        To better support uploading or copying of large objects, Amazon S3 provides the Multipart Upload API. \n",
    "        This allows you to upload large objects as a set of parts, which generally gives better network \n",
    "        utilization (through parallel transfers), the ability to pause and resume, and the ability to \n",
    "        upload objects where the size is initially unknown.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Range GETs\n",
    "        It is possible to download (GET) only a portion of an object in both Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier by \n",
    "        using something called a Range GET. Using the Range HTTP header in the GET request or equivalent \n",
    "        parameters in one of the SDK wrapper libraries, you specify a range of bytes of the object. This can \n",
    "        be useful in dealing with large objects when you have poor connectivity or to download only a known \n",
    "        portion of a large Amazon Glacier backup.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Cross-Region Replication\n",
    "        Cross-region replication is a feature of Amazon S3 that allows you to asynchronously replicate all \n",
    "        new objects in the source bucket in one AWS region to a target bucket in another region. Any metadata \n",
    "        and ACLs associated with the object are also part of the replication. After you set up cross-region\n",
    "        replication on your source bucket, any changes to the data, metadata, or ACLs on an object trigger a \n",
    "        new replication to the destination bucket. To enable cross-region replication, versioning must be \n",
    "        turned on for both source and destination buckets, and you must use an IAM policy to give Amazon \n",
    "        S3 permission to replicate objects on your behalf.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Logging\n",
    "        In order to track requests to your Amazon S3 bucket, you can enable Amazon S3 server access logs. \n",
    "        Logging is off by default, but it can easily be enabled.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Event Notifications\n",
    "        Amazon S3 event notifications can be sent in response to actions taken on objects uploaded or stored \n",
    "        in Amazon S3. Event notifications enable you to run workflows, send alerts, or perform other actions \n",
    "        in response to changes in your objects stored in Amazon S3. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications \n",
    "        to set up triggers to perform actions, such as transcoding media files when they are uploaded,processing\n",
    "        data files when they become available, and synchronizing Amazon S3 objects with other data stores.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Another common pattern is to use Amazon S3 as bulk “blob” storage for data, while keeping an index to \n",
    "        that data in another service, such as Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon RDS. This allows quick searches and \n",
    "        complex queries on key names without listing keys continually."
