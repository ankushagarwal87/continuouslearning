    "    Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud DNS web service\n",
    "    Amazon Route 53 performs three main functions:\n",
    "        Domain registration\n",
    "        DNS service\n",
    "        Health checking\n",
    "    When you create a resource record set, you choose a routing policy, which determines how Amazon Route 53\n",
    "        responds to queries. \n",
    "    Routing policy options are simple, weighted, latency-based, failover, and geolocation.\n",
    "    Routing policies can be associated with health checks, so resource health status is considered before it \n",
    "        even becomes a candidate in a conditional decision tree.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Simple\n",
    "    This is the default routing policy when you create a new resource. \n",
    "    Use a simple routing policy when you have a single resource that performs a given function for your domain\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Weighted\n",
    "    With weighted DNS, you can associate multiple resources (such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud [Amazon EC2]\n",
    "        instances or Elastic Load Balancing load balancers) with a single DNS name.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Latency-Based\n",
    "    Latency-based routing allows you to route your traffic based on the lowest network latency for your end \n",
    "        user (for example, using the AWS region that will give them the fastest response time).\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Failover\n",
    "    Use a failover routing policy to configure active-passive failover, in which one resource takes all the \n",
    "        traffic when it’s available and the other resource takes all the traffic when the first resource \n",
    "        isn’t available.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Geolocation\n",
    "    Geolocation routing lets you choose where Amazon Route 53 will send your traffic based on the \n",
    "        geographic location of your users (the location from which DNS queries originate). "
