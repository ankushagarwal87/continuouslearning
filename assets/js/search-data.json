Cost effective for infrequent,intermittent, unpredictable loads. . DNS . Intro . DNS Domain Registrar SOA Record - Start of Authority NS - Name Server Used by top level domain server to direct traffic to content DNS server A record - Address record TTL - Time to Live C Name - Canonical Name Alias record Elastic Load Balancer Do not have pre defined IPv4 address, resolve them using DNS name . Routing Policies . Simple - Random Weighted - Based on traffic weight specified Latency Based - Based on the region which gives lowest latency to user Failover - active/passive setup Geolocation - Based on the region of user Geoproximity - Traffic policy - Based on the region of user &amp; resources Multivalue - Simple with health check . VPC . Intro . Provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. Selection of own ip address range, creation of subnet, configuration of route tables &amp; network gateways. Create a public facing subnet for your webservers that has access to the internet. Place backend systems in a private subnet with no internet access. Leverage security group &amp; network control access list to control access to EC2 instance in subnet. Create a VPN connection between corporate data center &amp; VPC 1 subnet can&#39;t spread across AZ Security groups - Statful ACL - Stateless . CIDR . IP Address - 4 section of 8 bits 10.0.0.0/16 10.0.0.1 - First 10.0.255.254 - Last 2^(32-16) - Number of addres - 65K 255.255.0.0 - netmask 10.0.1.0/24 10.0.1.1 - First 10.0.1.254 - Last 2^(32-24) - Number of addres - 256 255.255.255.0 - netmask /28 - smallest in Amazon VPC . Default VPC . All subnet have route out to the internet Each EC2 instance have both a public &amp; private ip address . VPC Peering . Connect one VPC with other via direct network route using ip addresses Instances behave as if they were on same private network Can do peering across AWS accounts No transitive peering Can peer across region . Lab . When we create VPC, below all also gets created Route Table Security Group Network ACL Internet Gateway tied to VPN Amazon reserve 5 ip address within subnets . NAT . Network Addres Translation - Allow private subnet to communicate to Internet NAT Instance - single EC2 instance Disable source/destination check Must be on public subnet Behind a security group NAT Gateway Redundant inside AZ Start at 5 Gbps &amp; scale currently to 45 Gbps No need to patch Not associated with Secuity groups Automatically assigned a public ip address Edit route table to use NAT . Network ACL . Default ACL which gets created with VPN allows everything Deny everything by default when created new NACL Specify Inbound &amp; Outbound rule Rule apply in numerical order Block individual Ip address . ELB . Application LB Atleast two public subnet must be speified Network LB Classic LB . VPC Flow Logs . Capture information about IP information going to &amp; from network interface in VPC Flow Logs data is stored using CloudWatch Logs Can be stored at 3 levels VPC Subnet Network Interface Level Can&#39;t change flow log configuration once created Peer VPC need to be in same account for enabling Flow Logs Not all traffic is monitored . Bastions Host . Special purpose computer on a network specially designed &amp; configured to withstand attacks. SSH or RDP to private subnet through it Jump Boxes in Australia . Direct Connect . Establish a dedicated network connection between on premise to AWS . Global Accelerator . Direct traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network Improves availability &amp; performance of internet applications that are used by global audience By defualt provides two static IP addresses Accelerator DNS Name Network Zone Listener Endpoint group Endpoint . VPC End Points . Enables you to privately connect VPC to supported AWS services &amp; VPC endpoints services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT devices, VPN connection or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in VPC does not require public ip addresses to communicate with the resources in the service End points are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant &amp; highly avaliable VPC components that allow commuinication between instances in your VPC &amp; services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraint on your network traffic. Two types Interface End Point Elastic network interface with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic designated to a supported service. Gateway End Point Amazon S3 DynamoDB . HA Architecture . Load Balancer . Application LB Operate at level 7 &amp; are application aware Network LB Best suited for TCP traffic where extreme performance is required Operating at level 4 Classic LB Legacy ELB - Balance HTTP/HTTPS application &amp; use Layer-7 specific feature such as X-Forwarded &amp; sticky sessions. Also use strict level 4 balancing for applications that rely on TCP protocol Cost effective . Lab . Never get ip address for ELB . Advanced ELB . Sticky Session Allow you to bind user to particular EC2 instances Cross Zone Load Balancing Cross balance across AZ Path Pattern Create a listener with rules to forward requests based on the url path. . Autoscaling . Groups Logical components - Webserver groups , application group or database groups Configuration Template Groups uses launch template or launch configuration as a configuration template for its EC2 instances. Scaling Options Configure a group to scale based on the occurence of specified conditions or schedule Maintain current instance levela at all times Scale manually Scale based on a schedule Scale based on demand Use predictive scaling . HA Architecture . Use mutiple AZ &amp; multiple regions Multi-AZ for DR and Read Replicas for RDS Scaling out &amp; scaling up . Cloud Formation . Way of completely scripting your cloud environment . Elastic Beanstalk . Quickly deploy &amp; manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastucture that runs those applications. Beanstalk does capacity provisions, load balancing, scaling &amp; application health monitoring. . Applications . SQS - Simple Queue Service .
